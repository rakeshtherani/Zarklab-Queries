These analyses are designed to provide significant value to banking institutions by enhancing risk management, compliance, customer segmentation, and strategic decision-making. Each use case includes a description, analytical approach, sample SQL queries, and value proposition.

The analyses utilize data from the WALLET_COUNTERPARTY_SUMMARY and token_transfers tables, among others, to provide comprehensive insights into cryptocurrency transactions and their implications for banking operations and strategy.

## Analytical Use Cases

### 1. Customer Risk Profiling and Enhanced Due Diligence

**Description:**
Provide banks with a comprehensive risk profile of their customers by analyzing their blockchain transaction histories. This report helps banks perform enhanced due diligence (EDD) to identify high-risk customers, ensuring compliance with KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations.

**Analytical Approach:**

- Counterparty Risk Assessment
- Behavioral Patterns Analysis
- Flag Indicators Utilization

**Sample SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT
    wcs.WALLET_ADDRESS,
    SUM(wcs.TOTAL_USD_AMOUNT) AS total_usd_amount,
    SUM(wcs.TRANSACTION_COUNT) AS total_transactions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT wcs.COUNTERPARTY) AS unique_counterparties,
    MAX(wcs.COUNTERPARTY_FLAG) AS counterparty_risk_flag,
    MAX(wcs.FLAG_WALLET_NON_WHITELIST_BLACKLIST_COUNTERPARTY) AS blacklist_interaction_flag
FROM WALLET_COUNTERPARTY_SUMMARY wcs
GROUP BY wcs.WALLET_ADDRESS
HAVING total_usd_amount > 100000 OR counterparty_risk_flag = 1 OR blacklist_interaction_flag = 1
ORDER BY total_usd_amount DESC;
