## 3. Advanced Analytical Queries

### 3.1 Time-Series Analysis of Transaction Volumes

**Objective:** Analyze transaction volumes over time, including moving averages and cumulative sums, to identify trends and seasonality.

**SQL Query (Compatible with Snowflake, PostgreSQL, and ClickHouse):**
```sql
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('day', BLOCK_TIMESTAMP) AS transaction_date,
    COUNT(*) AS daily_transaction_count,
    SUM(USD_AMOUNT) AS daily_total_usd,
    AVG(SUM(USD_AMOUNT)) OVER (
        ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('day', BLOCK_TIMESTAMP)
        ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS moving_average_7_days,
    SUM(SUM(USD_AMOUNT)) OVER (
        ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('day', BLOCK_TIMESTAMP)
    ) AS cumulative_total_usd
FROM token_transfers
GROUP BY transaction_date
ORDER BY transaction_date;
```

**Explanation:**
- Calculates daily transaction counts and total USD amounts.
- Computes a 7-day moving average of daily transaction volumes.
- Provides a running total of USD amounts over time.

**Use Case:** Helps in identifying trends, seasonal patterns, and overall growth in transaction volumes.

### 3.2 Identifying Top Influential Wallets Using PageRank Algorithm

**Objective:** Use the PageRank algorithm to determine the most influential wallets based on transaction relationships.

**SQL Query (ClickHouse):**
```sql
-- Prepare edge list for PageRank
SELECT
    FROM_ADDRESS AS source,
    TO_ADDRESS AS target,
    COUNT(*) AS weight
FROM token_transfers
GROUP BY source, target
INTO OUTFILE 'edges.csv'
FORMAT CSV;

-- Assuming results are imported back into a table named 'wallet_pagerank'
SELECT
    wp.WALLET_ADDRESS,
    wp.PAGERANK,
    wcs.WALLET_NAME,
    wcs.WALLET_CATEGORY
FROM wallet_pagerank wp
LEFT JOIN WALLET_COUNTERPARTY_SUMMARY wcs ON wp.WALLET_ADDRESS = wcs.WALLET_ADDRESS
ORDER BY wp.PAGERANK DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**
- Prepares transaction data for PageRank analysis.
- Ranks wallets based on their connectivity and importance within the transaction network.

**Use Case:** Identifies key players, hubs, or potential influencers in the blockchain network.

### 3.3 Advanced Correlation Analysis Between Tokens

**Objective:** Analyze the correlation between transaction volumes of different tokens to identify interdependencies or market relationships.

**SQL Query (Snowflake):**
```sql
WITH daily_token_volumes AS (
    SELECT
        TOKEN_SYMBOL,
        DATE_TRUNC('day', BLOCK_TIMESTAMP) AS transaction_date,
        SUM(USD_AMOUNT) AS daily_volume
    FROM token_transfers

        TOKEN_SYMBOL,
        daily_volume
    FROM daily_token_volumes
)
SELECT
    PIVOT_TABLE.*
FROM pivoted_volumes
PIVOT (
    SUM(daily_volume) FOR TOKEN_SYMBOL IN ('TOKEN_A', 'TOKEN_B', 'TOKEN_C')  -- Replace with actual token symbols
) AS PIVOT_TABLE;

-- Calculate correlation between tokens
SELECT
    CORR(TOKEN_A_VOLUME, TOKEN_B_VOLUME) AS correlation_ab,
    CORR(TOKEN_A_VOLUME, TOKEN_C_VOLUME) AS correlation_ac,
    CORR(TOKEN_B_VOLUME, TOKEN_C_VOLUME) AS correlation_bc

        wcs.WALLET_ADDRESS,
        wcs.COUNTERPARTY,
        wc.cluster_level + 1,
        path || wcs.COUNTERPARTY
    FROM WALLET_COUNTERPARTY_SUMMARY wcs
    JOIN wallet_clusters wc ON wcs.WALLET_ADDRESS = wc.COUNTERPARTY
    WHERE NOT wcs.COUNTERPARTY = ANY(path)
)
SELECT
    WALLET_ADDRESS,
    COUNTERPARTY,
    cluster_level,
    path
FROM wallet_clusters
ORDER BY cluster_level DESC;
```

**Explanation:**
- Builds a hierarchical cluster of wallets based on their transaction paths.
- Reveals the depth and breadth of transaction relationships between wallets.

**Use Case:** Helps in detecting groups of wallets that may belong to the same entity or are closely related.

### 3.5 Anomaly Detection Using Machine Learning Functions

**Objective:** Apply unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms directly within the database to identify unusual transactions.

**SQL Query (Snowflake with Snowpark):**
```python
import snowflake.snowpark as sp
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

session = sp.Session.builder.configs({...}).create()

# Load data into a DataFrame
df = session.table('token_transfers').select(
    'USD_AMOUNT',
    'TRANSACTION_FEE',
    'BLOCK_TIMESTAMP'
)

# Convert to Pandas DataFrame
pdf = df.to_pandas()

# Train Isolation Forest model
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.01)
pdf['anomaly_score'] = model.fit_predict(pdf[['USD_AMOUNT', 'TRANSACTION_FEE']])

# Write anomalies back to Snowflake
anomalies = pdf[pdf['anomaly_score'] == -1]
session.write_pandas(anomalies, 'transaction_anomalies')
```

**Explanation:**
- Uses the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalous transactions based on amount and fees.
- Integrates machine learning directly within Snowflake using Snowpark.

    COUNT(DISTINCT WALLET_ADDRESS) AS unique_wallets,
    total_volume / unique_wallets AS turnover_ratio
FROM token_transfers
GROUP BY TOKEN_SYMBOL
ORDER BY turnover_ratio DESC;
```

**Explanation:**
- Calculates various metrics for each token, including total volume and number of unique wallets.
- Computes a turnover ratio as total volume divided by unique wallets.

**Use Case:** Useful for investors to identify highly liquid tokens and for exchanges to manage listings.

### 3.7 Time to Live (TTL) Analysis of Tokens in Wallets

        tm_in.TOKEN_SYMBOL,
        tm_in.BLOCK_TIMESTAMP AS received_time,
        tm_out.BLOCK_TIMESTAMP AS sent_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (tm_out.BLOCK_TIMESTAMP - tm_in.BLOCK_TIMESTAMP)) / (3600 * 24) AS days_held
    FROM token_movements tm_in
    JOIN token_movements tm_out ON tm_in.WALLET_ADDRESS = tm_out.WALLET_ADDRESS
        AND tm_in.TOKEN_SYMBOL = tm_out.TOKEN_SYMBOL
        AND tm_in.rn + 1 = tm_out.rn
    WHERE tm_in.DIRECTION = 'received' AND tm_out.DIRECTION = 'sent'
)
SELECT
    TOKEN_SYMBOL,
    AVG(days_held) AS average_days_held,
    MIN(days_held) AS min_days_held,
    MAX(days_held) AS max_days_held
FROM token_lifespans
GROUP BY TOKEN_SYMBOL
ORDER BY average_days_held ASC;
```

**Explanation:**
