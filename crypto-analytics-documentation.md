## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a series of analytical use cases designed for retail cryptocurrency investors. These analyses leverage blockchain data to provide valuable insights into market trends, token movements, and potential investment opportunities. Each use case includes a description, analytical approach, sample SQL queries, and the value proposition for investors.

## 2. Data Tables

The analyses in this document primarily use two main data tables:

1. `WALLET_COUNTERPARTY_SUMMARY`: Contains aggregated data about wallet activities and balances.
2. `token_transfers`: Records individual token transfer transactions.

Additional tables may be referenced in specific use cases.

## 3. Analytical Use Cases

### 3.1 Whale Movement Tracking and Analysis

#### Description
This analysis focuses on tracking the activities of large token holders ("whales") to understand their potential impact on the market.

#### Analytical Approach
- Identify wallets with large holdings of specific tokens
- Monitor significant transactions made by these whales
- Assess the market impact of whale transactions
- Set up alerts for large transfers

#### SQL Queries

```sql
-- Identify wallets with large token holdings
SELECT
    wcs.WALLET_ADDRESS,
    SUM(wcs.TOTAL_USD_AMOUNT) AS total_holdings
FROM WALLET_COUNTERPARTY_SUMMARY wcs
WHERE wcs.TOKEN_SYMBOL = 'TOKEN_SYMBOL_OF_INTEREST'
GROUP BY wcs.WALLET_ADDRESS
HAVING total_holdings > 1000000 -- Whale threshold
ORDER BY total_holdings DESC;

-- Track recent large transactions by whales
SELECT
    tt.TRANSACTION_HASH,
    tt.WALLET_ADDRESS,
    tt.COUNTERPARTY,
    tt.TOKEN_SYMBOL,
    tt.USD_AMOUNT,
    tt.BLOCK_TIMESTAMP
FROM token_transfers tt
WHERE tt.WALLET_ADDRESS IN (SELECT WALLET_ADDRESS FROM whales)
  AND tt.USD_AMOUNT > 100000 -- Significant transaction threshold
ORDER BY tt.BLOCK_TIMESTAMP DESC;
```

#### Value Proposition
- Market Insight: Anticipate potential market movements
- Risk Management: Adjust positions in response to whale activities
- Strategic Timing: Identify optimal times to buy or sell

### 3.2 Token Trend Analysis and Momentum Indicators

#### Description
This analysis identifies tokens gaining momentum by analyzing transfer trends and transaction volumes.

#### Analytical Approach
- Track increases in transaction volumes for different tokens
- Monitor the number of transactions over time
- Calculate momentum indicators like moving averages
- Rank tokens based on growth in activity

#### SQL Queries

```sql
-- Calculate daily transaction volumes for tokens
SELECT
    tt.TOKEN_SYMBOL,
    DATE(tt.BLOCK_TIMESTAMP) AS transaction_date,
    SUM(tt.USD_AMOUNT) AS total_volume,
    COUNT(*) AS transaction_count
FROM token_transfers tt
GROUP BY tt.TOKEN_SYMBOL, transaction_date
ORDER BY transaction_date, total_volume DESC;

-- Identify tokens with increasing volume over the past week
WITH weekly_volume AS (
    SELECT
        tt.TOKEN_SYMBOL,
        SUM(tt.USD_AMOUNT) AS total_volume,
        DATE(tt.BLOCK_TIMESTAMP) AS transaction_date
    FROM token_transfers tt
    WHERE tt.BLOCK_TIMESTAMP >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 DAYS'
    GROUP BY tt.TOKEN_SYMBOL, transaction_date
)
SELECT
    wv.TOKEN_SYMBOL,
    SUM(wv.total_volume) AS weekly_volume
FROM weekly_volume wv
GROUP BY wv.TOKEN_SYMBOL
ORDER BY weekly_volume DESC;
```

#### Value Proposition

- Informed Decision-Making: Data-driven insights for investment choices
- Market Awareness: Stay updated on emerging trends

### 3.3 Early Detection of New Token Listings and Activities

#### Description
This analysis monitors blockchain data to detect new token listings and increased activities in recently launched tokens.

#### Analytical Approach
- Detect tokens that have recently appeared on the blockchain
- Track initial transaction volumes and wallet counts
- Analyze the rate of adoption and usage
- Evaluate potential risks associated with new tokens

#### SQL Queries

```sql
-- Identify new tokens based on first appearance
SELECT
    tt.TOKEN_SYMBOL,
    MIN(tt.BLOCK_TIMESTAMP) AS first_seen
FROM token_transfers tt
GROUP BY tt.TOKEN_SYMBOL
ORDER BY first_seen DESC
LIMIT 50; -- Number of recent tokens to consider

-- Monitor activity for new tokens
SELECT
    tt.TOKEN_SYMBOL,
    COUNT(DISTINCT tt.WALLET_ADDRESS) AS unique_wallets,
    SUM(tt.USD_AMOUNT) AS total_volume
FROM token_transfers tt
WHERE tt.TOKEN_SYMBOL IN (SELECT TOKEN_SYMBOL FROM new_tokens)
GROUP BY tt.TOKEN_SYMBOL
ORDER BY total_volume DESC;

SELECT
    wcs.TOKEN_SYMBOL,
    wcs.WALLET_ADDRESS,
    SUM(wcs.TOTAL_USD_AMOUNT) AS total_holdings
FROM WALLET_COUNTERPARTY_SUMMARY wcs
WHERE wcs.TOKEN_SYMBOL = 'TOKEN_SYMBOL_OF_INTEREST'
GROUP BY wcs.TOKEN_SYMBOL, wcs.WALLET_ADDRESS
ORDER BY total_holdings DESC;

-- Determine concentration levels
SELECT
    total_holdings,
    SUM(total_holdings) OVER (ORDER BY total_holdings DESC) AS cumulative_holdings,
    (SUM(total_holdings) OVER (ORDER BY total_holdings DESC) / total_supply) * 100 AS cumulative_percentage
FROM (
    SELECT
        wcs.WALLET_ADDRESS,
        SUM(wcs.TOTAL_USD_AMOUNT) AS total_holdings
    FROM WALLET_COUNTERPARTY_SUMMARY wcs
    WHERE wcs.TOKEN_SYMBOL = 'TOKEN_SYMBOL_OF_INTEREST'

SELECT
    tt.WALLET_ADDRESS,
    tt.TOKEN_SYMBOL,
    SUM(CASE WHEN tt.DIRECTION = 'received' THEN tt.USD_AMOUNT ELSE -tt.USD_AMOUNT END) AS net_position_change
FROM token_transfers tt
WHERE tt.TOKEN_SYMBOL = 'TOKEN_SYMBOL_OF_INTEREST'
GROUP BY tt.WALLET_ADDRESS, tt.TOKEN_SYMBOL
HAVING net_position_change > 0
ORDER BY net_position_change DESC;
