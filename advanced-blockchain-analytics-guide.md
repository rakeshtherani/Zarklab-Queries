**SQL Query:**
```sql
WITH rapid_in_out AS (
    SELECT
        tt.WALLET_ADDRESS,
        COUNT(*) AS tx_count,
        SUM(CASE WHEN tt.DIRECTION = 'received' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS received_count,
        SUM(CASE WHEN tt.DIRECTION = 'sent' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS sent_count,
        AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (LEAD(tt.BLOCK_TIMESTAMP) OVER (PARTITION BY tt.WALLET_ADDRESS ORDER BY tt.BLOCK_TIMESTAMP) - tt.BLOCK_TIMESTAMP))) AS avg_time_between_tx
    FROM token_transfers tt
    GROUP BY tt.WALLET_ADDRESS
    HAVING received_count > 10 AND sent_count > 10
)
SELECT
    ri.WALLET_ADDRESS,
    ri.tx_count,
    ri.avg_time_between_tx
FROM rapid_in_out ri
WHERE ri.avg_time_between_tx < 60 -- Average time between transactions less than 60 seconds
ORDER BY ri.tx_count DESC;
```

**Explanation:**
- Purpose: Identifies wallets with a high number of incoming and outgoing transactions occurring rapidly, a characteristic of mixing services.
- Use Case: Compliance teams can investigate these wallets further to ensure they are not facilitating illicit activities.

### 2.2 Clustering Wallets Based on Transaction Behavior

**Objective:** Group wallets into clusters based on similarities in their transaction behaviors using k-means clustering directly in SQL.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
-- Prepare data for clustering
CREATE TEMP TABLE wallet_features AS
SELECT
    WALLET_ADDRESS,
    COUNT(*) AS tx_count,
    SUM(USD_AMOUNT) AS total_usd_amount,
    AVG(USD_AMOUNT) AS avg_usd_amount,
    COUNT(DISTINCT COUNTERPARTY) AS unique_counterparties
FROM token_transfers
GROUP BY WALLET_ADDRESS;

-- Perform k-means clustering
SELECT madlib.kmeans(
    'wallet_features',
    'wallet_clusters',
    'ARRAY[tx_count, total_usd_amount, avg_usd_amount, unique_counterparties]',
    5  -- Number of clusters
);

-- View clustered wallets
SELECT *
FROM wallet_clusters
ORDER BY cluster_id, total_usd_amount DESC;
```

**Explanation:**
- Purpose: Groups wallets into clusters based on transaction count, total USD amount transacted, average transaction amount, and the number of unique counterparties.

    FROM token_transfers tt
    GROUP BY tt.WALLET_ADDRESS
)
SELECT
    fd.WALLET_ADDRESS,
    fd.total_fees,
    fd.total_usd_amount,
    fd.avg_fee_ratio
FROM fee_data fd
WHERE fd.avg_fee_ratio > (
    SELECT AVG(fd_inner.avg_fee_ratio) * 1.5 FROM fee_data fd_inner
) -- Wallets paying 50% more in fees relative to transaction amounts
ORDER BY fd.avg_fee_ratio DESC;
```

**Explanation:**
