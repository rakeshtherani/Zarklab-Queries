        tt.WALLET_ADDRESS,
        SUM(tt.USD_AMOUNT) AS total_income,
        COUNT(*) AS income_transactions
    FROM token_transfers tt
    WHERE tt.DIRECTION = 'received'
    GROUP BY tt.WALLET_ADDRESS
    HAVING total_income > 100000 -- Threshold for significant income
),
-- Step 2: Identify wallets with significant outgoing transactions (possible sales)
wallet_outflows AS (
